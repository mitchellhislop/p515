Adds a widget for section (or top level page) based page navigation. Essential for CMS! Includes simple function for template developers.

== Description ==

Adds a widget to your sidebar for section based navigation. Essential for CMS implementations! 

The title of the widget is the top level page within the current section. Shows all page siblings (except on the top level page), all parents and grandparents (and higher), the siblings of all parents and grandparents (up to top level page), and any immediate children of the current page. Can also be called by a function inside template files.

It includes a simple widget configuration panel. From this panel you can:

1. Determine whether the widget should appear on the home page
1. Override standard behavior and have the widget show all pages in the current section
1. Determine whether the widget should appear even if the section only has one page (the top level)
1. Provide a list of pages to exclude from the output
1. Determine whether the section navigation should still appear when viewing excluded pages
1. Use a specific widget title (i.e. In This Section), or just use the top level page title
1. Determine whether the section title should be linked
1. Determine page sort order (defaults to menu order)

The widget uses standard WordPress navigation classes, in addition to a unique class around the widget, for easy styling.

ATTENTION UPGRADERS: version 2.0 represents a fundamental change to the plug-in's architecture. Version 2 will attempt to seamlessly upgrade the old the widget, but you should document your current settings before pgrading. If you are calling it by a function in the template (not using the widget), you will be required to update your template, unless you were using the default settings. The function now has 1 parameter: arguments for the output of the widget, as detailed under installation instructions.

Compatible with WordPress MU.


== Installation ==

1. Install easily with the WordPress plugin control panel or manually download the plugin and upload the extracted
folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Widget users can add it to the sidebar by going to the "Widgets" menu under "Appearance" and adding the "Simple
Section Navigation" widget. Open the widget to configure.
1. Template authors can call the navigation by using the `simple_section_nav` function. The function accepts a single
argument in the form of a classical WordPress set of parameters.

= Parameters =

* `show_all` - Always show all pages in current section (default: false)
* `exclude` - Page IDs, seperated by commas, of pages to exclude (default: '')
* `hide_on_excluded` - No navigation on excluded pages (default: true)
* `show_on_home` - Show top level page list on home page (default: false)
* `show_empty` - Output even if empty section (default: false)
* `sort_by` - Page sort order; can use any WordPress page list sort value (default: menu_order)
* `title` - Provide a specific widget title; default is the top level page title (default: '')
* `a_heading` - Show all pages in section (default: false)
* `before_widget` - HTML before widget (default: `<div>`)
* `after_widget` - HTML after widget (default: `</div>`)
* `before_title` - HTML before widget (default: `<h2 class="widgettitle">`)
* `after_title` - HTML after widget (default: `</h2>`)

= Example =
